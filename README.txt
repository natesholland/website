                          ------------------- INTRO LEVEL  D3.js Project --------------- 

KEY: BLUE AVERAGE INCOME
     GREY ADJUSTED INCOME BASED ON COST OF LIVING

This projects purpose is to use and teach the javascript library d3.js.  d3 stands for data driven documentation, and is a library to visualize and display data.  In this project the user will be destructing and reconstructing a double bar graph made using the 3d.js library. The user will learn how to use the library to visualize data in fun and understandable ways.  In this project, data about average income vs adjusted income based on the cost of living is graphed by state.  For this project the user will either need to know or will learn : SVG, JavaScript and the d3.js library. The user will only be learning the d3.js library and will be given the html and css to make the code work

START PROJECT
1)First make a simple svg board.                                        (d3first.js)
2)First the user should make a static single bar graph.                 (d3second.js) 
3)Then the user makes the bars expand/grow.                             (d3third.js)
4)Then make the bars move from a across the screen.                     (d3fourth.js)
5)Next space the bars out to allow another bar graph to be placed in.   (d3fifth.js)
6)Input the next bar graph.                                             (d3sixth.js)
7)Make the second bar graph expand and move.                            (d3seventh.js)
8)Add text and move it.                                                 (d3final.js)

The steps above are the steps that the users should be given to construct their bar graph.  Each file contains the javascript code that the user should have to finish that step.  The code on each file has a comment per new line explaining what that line does.    



The user will begin by seeing our finished project.  Then the user will be guided step by step slowly building their skills and knowledge of d3 as well while at the same time creating a cool and functional bar graph to display their data. Through these steps the coder will be able to analyze and learn what each line in the program does and allow them to learn the library.  

FILES
The html, css and javascript files should all be in the same folder.  The d3 library is currently being pulled from online so their isn't a need a download it.  To see each step, change the havascript file in the html file to any file listed above in the steps.
